## What I (bruhcolate / matthew) found interesting

As an aspiring software developer and someone who constantly questions even the smallest decisions, I often have concerns if I made the right academic choice. While I've enjoyed what I've learned over the past three and a half years, I wonder if that trend will continue into my career. I found this article interesting because I thought it would alleviate, or validate, some of my concerns of becoming a software developer. The article helps me understand what I should expect and allows me to make any necessary changes to ensure its right for me. I hope this article is helpful to whomever else reads it.

This article provides a pretty holistic view of what it means to be a software engineer. It definitely highlights some key concerns and benefits of a software engineering career. I think it would have been helpful if the article provided some ballpark salary ranges, for readers' reference.
